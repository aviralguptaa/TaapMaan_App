# TaapMaan - The Temperature and Humdity Monitoring App

It is very difficult to maintain a record of temperatures in each room and floors of large buildings. Managing and tracking each room individually becomes a very tedious task, to make it easy to manage we have built this mobile app so that temperature monitoring and management in large buildings can be done at your palm with convenience.<br>

We have built a fully-fledged Temperature Monitoring **Flutter** Mobile application using flutter and the temperature sensors installed in rooms which will help to monitor and manage temperature at every room and floor of any building. In our case Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector 128.
<br>


### Our Approach

The project will be using the temperature monitoring sensors that are installed in every classroom of JIIT 128.The data from the sensors will be collected and passed on to the mobile application to display the temperatures in each room at a single place.<br>
The data from the temperature sensors are collected in a google sheet from where using the Google Sheets API we will parse the data to our **FLUTTER** app.

### Future Scope
Future work would be focused more on increasing sensors on this system to fetch more data from even greater number of rooms and floors and incorporating better and expensive sensors with higher accuracy and maximizing responsiveness.
